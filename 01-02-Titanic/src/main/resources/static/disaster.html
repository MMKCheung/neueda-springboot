<p>Titanic was under the command of Edward Smith, who also went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest 
people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout 
Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States. The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of 
comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. 
A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger "marconigrams" and for the ship's operational use. 
Although Titanic had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, there 
were not enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard, due to outdated maritime safety regulations. Titanic only 
carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number on board, and one third of her total capacity. 
The ship carried lifeboat davits which could lower three lifeboats each, for a total of 48 boats. However, Titanic carried only
 a total of 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved to be hard to launch during the sinking.</p>

<p>After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland 
before heading west to New York. On 14 April, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, 
she hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time. The collision caused the ship's hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard 
(right) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; she could only survive four flooding. 
Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially loaded.
 A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "women and children first" protocol for loading lifeboats.
  At 2:20 a.m., she broke apart and foundered—with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after 
  the Titanic sank, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived at the scene, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.</p>
